# WpfBrowser

Hello! I made this application to test out a factory pattern for creating view models on the fly in MVVM. There are still a few issues with the application, but I think it serves it's purpose well and has given me some insight for best practices when setting up the architecture of a WPF application. Some of the real heavy lifting is done in the tab view model class! Towards the end of the file, there are still a few issues I need to resolve. Specifically in the ScopedContainerSupportedTabViewModelFactory class's Create method. I need to implement a solution for disposing the Scope that my service provider creates in this method. Also, there are some issues with temporal coupling the ScopedTabViewModels Scosaf  these comments to present for a work demo, but I would also take a look at the app.xaml.cs file. Here, you can see some commented out singletons I was trying to use for my TabViewModels before I landed on the TabViewModelFacotry being the best approach. I left comments explaining what I thought was wrong with these singletons, (mainly issues with temporal coupling or viewmodels not being instantiated by the DI container), but hopefully this can show my thought process as I was creating this!
